========================

requirements:

1. nodejs
2. compass

development workflow setup:

1. install dependencies: `npm i`
2. build project and start dev server: `gulp`

notes:

1. there is neither livereload, nor hot module replacement yet (coming soon), so - after compilation, refresh page manually
2. for better jsx support use WebStorm 10 (EAP version: https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/WI/WebStorm+EAP)
